    "# While Loops, Break and Continue\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier in the course, we learned how to iterate over collections. But is there a way to have a loop **without** a collection to iterate over? Well, another way to create a loop is with **while** loops. We can use a while loop to perform the same action over and over until a condition is no longer `True`. We don't even need an *iterable* or collection to iterate over. We can just define a condition and perform the given code block until the condition is no longer `True`. Pretty cool, right?   \n",
    "\n",
    "Or what if we would like to have a loop that stops at a certain point? Let's say we only want to collect half of the elements of a list, or stop a list once we find the first matching element? To perform operations like these we'll need `break` and `continue` statements. These statements **control the flow** of our loops and will help us make our loops even more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use a `while` loop\n",
    "* Use `break` and `continue` to add control flow to a `while` loop\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a `while` loop and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "A `while` loop is just that; a loop! Similar to a `for` loop, except there is no need for a collection to iterate over. Instead, a `while` loop uses a condition to know when to stop executing. When the condition is true, the block inside the while loop is executed. When that condition is false, we exit the while loop and move on to the next piece of our code.\n",

They are used in tandem with conditional statements (`if`, `elif`), inside loops, and they *break* out of a loop if a condition is met or *continue* a loop if a different condition is met.

    "So, let's unpack what's happening here. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we have a `for` loop that is iterating over our list, `numbers`, which has 30 numbers in it. Then we see that we have an `if` statement that only executes its code when our `new_list` has more than 4 numbers in it. Once this condition is met, we **break** out of our loop. We then have an `elif` statement that adds any even number to the `new_list`, and a final `elif` statement that tests to see if the number is odd, and if it is odd, then it **continue**s to the next element in our for loop's iteration process. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, first let's dig into the `continue` statement. `continue` is telling our loop to **skip** any code that comes after it and go straight to the next element in our loop. So, if we are dealing with number `1` in our list of numbers, we will hit our `continue` statement and immediately go to the next element in our for loop (i.e. `2`). Any code that comes after the `continue` will **not** be executed, **but** our for loop does **not** end execution. This contrasts with the `break` statement. Our break statement is only executed when we have met our condition that the `new_list` has reached the number of elements we want it to have. Once the `break` statement is executed, it will end the execution of the `for` loop altogether. All code after the `break` statement will be ignored, similar to our `continue`, but there will be no next step to the iteration. It stops the loop and that's the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, essentially, we can use `continue` to *skip* operation on elements and code below `continue`. We can then use `break` when we have a condition that tells us we want to stop the process altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can look at two examples to really reinforce this difference in execution."

    "Let's say you have a collection of elements and that you want to filter out certain elements and create a new list with the elements you want. But you also want to perform a complex operation on each of the elements you **do** want. Well, you don't want to perform that operation on the elements that you don't want and you don't want to have to write multiple `for` loops on the collection. So, a `continue` statement would allow you to optimize your performance and avoid needing to perform those operations. And a `break` statement can be used when you want to put a limit on the number of iterations you perform, the number of elements you append to a new list, or even just stop your iteration when you have found the first element you want.

    "Okay, so, as we can tell from our code. We wanted to create a list of 4 names that are properly formatted and that **don't** start with the letter `w`. To optimize our code, we first check to see if the name starts with `w`. If it does, we skip all other operations that we need to do and go to the next name. Next we check to see if we have hit our quota of 4 names. If we have, then stop the iteration altogether. Lastly, if neither condition is met, format the given name and append it to our new list of formatted names.\n",
    "This way, we are optimizing our code by making sure that we eliminate performing any operations that aren't absolutely necessary at each step. You may have noticed the variable, `check_count`. If you are feeling unconvinced that the `break` and `continue` are not cutting down on the number of times our code is executing, run the cell below and compare the `check_count`s, which increment after **each** check of a conditional statement."

And on top of that, to get the same result we have to have a **nested** `if` statement, which is, technically put, ***gross***. All joking aside, nested `if` statements should be avoided if they can be since they make our code less readable and therefore harder to maintain on top of being half as efficient as our previous code.\n",

    "Awesome! `while` loops are great, right? We can use them to perform operations based on the truthiness of a condition instead of needing to iterate over the elements in a collection. They provide a more dynamic way to perform operations, but we need to be careful when writing while loops because we need to have a condition that ends the loop. Otherwise we will have an **infinite** loop which will give us and our computer a real headache. In this lesson, we also introduced some *control flow* statements, `break` and `continue`, which allow us to make our conditional statements and the rest of our code more efficient and more readable. We call these statements control flow statements because they allow us to *control* the *flow* of our code's execution. "
